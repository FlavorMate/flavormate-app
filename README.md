FlavorMate is your personal, self-hosted, open-source recipe management app, available on iOS, macOS, Android, and as a
web application. You can also build it from source for Linux and Windows. Organize your culinary creations by
categorizing and tagging them to suit your needs. Whether youâ€™re crafting a recipe from scratch or importing one from
the web, FlavorMate makes it easy.

Stuck on what to cook or bake? Let FlavorMate inspire you with the Recipe of the Day or choose a dish at random. For
those following vegetarian or vegan lifestyles, simply set your preference in your profile, and you'll receive recipes
tailored just for you.
